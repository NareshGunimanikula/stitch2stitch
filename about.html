		<h1 class="minus">Six Reasons Why You Should Shop With Us.</h1>
			<section class="reasons">
			<ul>
				<li>We provide a testing module for satisfaction of the consumer.</li>
				<li>The biggest draw to my business is our customer service and authenticity. I believe giving my customers a fair and honest deal and a personal customer service only a business is capable of providing separated my business from everyone else. It’s very important for my company to develop a trustful relationship with customers. Encouraging our customers to share their opinions helps nourish and flourish the relationship. Being transparent and offering reliable and friendly service is the biggest draw to my business.</li>
				<li>Our business’s biggest draw is the unique service we provide. There are many bookkeepers in our area, but we are the only one who provides CFO consulting services to all of our clients for no additional charge.</li>
				<li>We are known for the long term personal relationships we have with hundreds of our customers who prefer to patronize a locally owned, family run business. We have been in business for over 17 years in the same location, and many of our employees have been with us for over 10+ years. Our customers also appreciate that we deeply love our furry friends and are a pet-friendly café, donating thousands each year.</li>
				<li>You will call anytime, only to be transferred seven times and put on hold. Even when you speak to a customer service representative, that person is so far removed from the decision-making process, there’s little concern that the company will lose you as a customer. When you shop local, owner is usually directly connected to every employee in the store.</li>
				<li>Make transaction easy, safe, and secure. People are more likely to hand over their money when they perceive the risk as minimal. It’s best to reassure potential customers with robust guarantees, a solid privacy policy, and secure payment procedures.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1>Our guarantee.</h1>
			<p>When we sell a goods or a service to a consumer online or via other means of the distance communication or outside a shop, the consumer has the right to return the item or cancel the service within 14 days. This is sometimes referred to as the cooling-off period or the withdrawal period. No reason or justification has to be given by the consumer. If the product we sold turns out to be faulty- or doesn’t look or work as advertised – within the timeframe of the legal guarantee, we are responsible for this. Be aware that we are legally bound by any public statement we make about our products, especially through advertisements or on labels.</p>
			<p>Our customer have the right to ask to do any of the following without any charge: repair the product, replace the product, and reduce the price. We can also offer the consumer an additional commercial guarantee. This can either be included in the price of the product or at an extra cost. This warranty does not replace the legal guarantee, which is always a minimum of 2 years, and you must inform the consumer that this will not affect their right to the legal guarantee. </p>
