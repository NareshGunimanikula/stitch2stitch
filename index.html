			<p>Singer sewing machines have inspired and helped seamstress and fashion designers for generations. The latest models continue this tradition of ease of use, innovation and value for money. The Singer range includes good quality standard machines, electronic and computerized models.</p>
			<p>This is the best machine I have every owned. It is very simple to use and by far the best. I will never need another machine again. This machine will last me a lifetime. I am in love with this machine. I can't go one day without using this machine. I have to find something to sew just so I can use my machine. I get a lot of my sewing projects done with this machine.</p>
			<p>The machine performs brilliantly .Easy to use, precise and even stitching, good range of stitching patterns, threading up straightforward and the needle threader is great and easy to use. It has many more stiches than I even know what to do with. I can't wait to get more use out of it. This is a great product overall.</p>
